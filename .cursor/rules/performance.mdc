  All Node.js code must be optimized for high performance and maximum throughput.
  - Always utilize all available CPU cores using Node.js cluster or worker_threads where appropriate.
  - Avoid blocking the event loop; use asynchronous/non-blocking patterns.
  - Profile and address performance bottlenecks.
  - Write code that maximizes concurrency and throughput.
  This rule is always applied to ensure the app can handle the highest possible concurrency.
