# Atomic Design Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed User Feedback Issues
- **Interface Files**: Removed re-exporting of types from all `.interface.ts` files
- **Test Files**: Added explicit `@testing-library/jest-dom` imports to test files
- **Input Interface**: Fixed size property conflict by using `Omit<React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, 'size'>`

### 2. Atomic Design Structure Created
```

│   ├── Button/ ✅ Complete
│   ├── Input/ ✅ Interface only
│   ├── AnimatedCounter/ ✅ Complete
│   └── ScrollReveal/ ✅ Complete

### 3. Components Moved to Atomic Design
- **AnimatedCounter**: Moved from root to `atoms/AnimatedCounter/` with updated interface
- **ScrollReveal**: Moved from root to `atoms/ScrollReveal/` with updated interface
- **BankLoginForm**: Already in `organisms/BankLoginForm/` with complete implementation

## 🔄 In Progress

### 1. Outstanding Components to Arrange
The following components still need to be moved to their atomic design locations:

#### Atoms (Simple UI Elements)
- None remaining - all atoms are complete

#### Molecules (Simple Combinations)
- **FormField**: Interface exists, needs implementation and test files

#### Organisms (Complex UI Sections)
- **Navigation**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **Footer**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files  
- **HeroSection**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **SummaryCards**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **DataTable**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files

#### Templates (Page Layouts)
- **DashboardLayout**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **HomeLayout**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **ProductLayout**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files

#### Pages (Complete Pages)
- **DashboardPage**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **HomePage**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **ProductsPage**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **BankDashboardPage**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files
- **InternalDashboardPage**: Needs interface, test, and implementation files

## 📋 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Molecules
1. Implement `FormField` component with test files
2. Move existing form field logic from other components

### Priority 2: Complete Organisms
1. **Navigation**: Create interface, test, and move existing Navigation component
2. **Footer**: Create interface, test, and move existing Footer component
3. **HeroSection**: Create interface, test, and move existing HeroSection component
4. **SummaryCards**: Create interface, test, and move existing SummaryCards component
5. **DataTable**: Create interface, test, and move existing DataTable component

### Priority 3: Complete Templates
1. **DashboardLayout**: Create layout template for dashboard pages
2. **HomeLayout**: Create layout template for home page
3. **ProductLayout**: Create layout template for product pages

### Priority 4: Complete Pages
1. **DashboardPage**: Create complete dashboard page
2. **HomePage**: Create complete home page
3. **ProductsPage**: Create complete products page
4. **BankDashboardPage**: Create complete bank dashboard page
5. **InternalDashboardPage**: Create complete internal dashboard page

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [x] All interface files follow atomic design principles
- [x] All test files have explicit testing library imports
- [x] No re-exporting in interface files
- [x] Atomic design directory structure created
- [ ] All existing components moved to appropriate atomic design levels
- [ ] All components have interface, test, and implementation files
- [ ] No new functionality added unless it solves a bug
- [ ] All components follow VP-level coding standards

## 📝 Notes

- Following VP-level rules: No new functionality unless it solves bugs
- Focus on refactoring existing components without adding features
- Maintain clean, coherent, simple but robust code
- Each component must have separate interface, test, and implementation files
- All tests must validate the public interface
