# A/B Testing Strategy for Rails Banking Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the A/B testing strategy for Rails' user acquisition and registration optimization. Currently **ON HOLD** while we focus on perfecting the weekend settlements product for banks.

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ PLANNED - Implementation postponed until weekend settlements product is mature

---

## Current Product Context

### Weekend Settlements (Current Product)
- **Target Market:** Established banks in South Africa
- **Value Proposition:** Real-time transaction processing during weekends
- **Business Model:** B2B2C - Banks buy Rails infrastructure to serve their customers
- **Status:** Active development and validation

### Future Products (Post-License)
- **Deposit Services:** Rails becomes licensed bank serving businesses directly
- **Full Banking Infrastructure:** Complete B2B banking platform
- **Business Model:** Direct B2B - Businesses bank with Rails

---

## A/B Testing Framework

### Phase 1: Bank Partnership Optimization (Immediate - Post Weekend Settlements)

#### Target Audience: Established Banks
**Current Registration Flow:**
```
Landing Page â†’ Bank Registration (4-step form) â†’ Manual Approval â†’ Weekend Settlements Access
```

#### A/B Test 1: Bank Messaging
**Hypothesis:** Exclusivity messaging converts better than technical messaging for bank executives

**Variants:**
- **Variant A:** "Exclusive Banking Partnership"
  - Headline: "Join SA's Most Exclusive Banking Infrastructure Network" 
  - CTA: "Apply for Partnership"
  - Tone: Elite, selective, partnership-focused
  
- **Variant B:** "Elite Infrastructure Partner"  
  - Headline: "Elite Infrastructure for Modern Banking"
  - CTA: "Become an Infrastructure Partner"
  - Tone: Technical excellence, innovation-focused

**Success Metrics:**
- Registration completion rate
- Form abandonment by step
- Time to complete registration
- Quality of applications (manual review score)
- Partnership conversion rate

#### A/B Test 2: Registration Form Optimization
**Hypothesis:** Progressive disclosure reduces abandonment

**Variants:**
- **Current:** 4-step form with all fields visible
- **Test:** Progressive form with contextual field reveal
- **Test:** Single-page form with smart sections

**Success Metrics:**
- Step completion rates
- Time per step
- Form abandonment points
- Validation error rates

---

### Phase 2: Future Product Validation (Post-License)

#### Target Audience: Businesses + Developers
**Future Registration Flow:**
```
Landing Page â†’ Intent Selection â†’ Tier-Specific Registration â†’ Product Access
```

#### Intent Selection Question
**Hypothesis:** Intent-based routing improves conversion vs demographic routing

**Test Options:**
- **Option A:** "What describes you best?"
  - "I represent an established bank"
  - "I run a business that needs banking services" 
  - "I'm a developer building financial products"

- **Option B:** "What's your primary goal?"
  - "Enhance our bank's weekend settlement capabilities"
  - "Get modern banking services for my business"
  - "Access banking infrastructure APIs"

- **Option C:** "How will you use Rails?"
  - "Bank partnership for weekend settlements"
  - "Business banking when Rails gets deposit license"
  - "API integration for financial products"

#### Three-Tier Product Strategy

##### Tier 1: Bank Partnerships (Current)
**Product:** Weekend Settlements
**Target:** Established banks with existing customer bases
**Registration:** Full compliance verification required
**Outcome:** Manual approval â†’ API access

##### Tier 2: Business Banking (Future - Post License)
**Product:** Direct deposit and banking services
**Target:** Businesses looking for modern banking
**Registration:** Business verification + simplified KYC
**Outcome:** Bank account + Rails banking services

##### Tier 3: Developer Platform (Future)
**Product:** Banking infrastructure APIs
**Target:** Fintech developers, consultants, enterprise developers
**Registration:** Minimal verification
**Outcome:** Sandbox access â†’ API integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks

### Phase 2 Risks
- **Risk:** Complex multi-tier UX confuses users
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple binary choice, iterate

- **Risk:** Developer tier has no real value
- **Mitigation:** Focus on business tier, developer tier for market research only
